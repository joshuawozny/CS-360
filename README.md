# CS-360
## Course Description
Students will apply mobile development principles and best practices to develop mobile applications using user-centered design principles and industry standards. Upon completion of a fully-functional mobile application, students will conduct security, product assuredness, and compatibility checks before launching the application.

## Project
<p>I developed an inventory app, <b><i>Effiecient Stock</i></b>, for my project in the course. It was meant to be used to manage inventory within a warehouse with the ability to receive, store, and consume items in inventory, while tracking the current quantity and location in the warehouse the item is located.</p>
<p>To accomplish this the following screens and UI elements were required</p>

* Login Screen with username, and password.
* Registration Screen that allowed a new user to register for access.
* Inventory View Screen to list all current inventory, with the ability to filter specific inventory.
* Receive Inventory Screen to receive new invenotry (including new items and current items).
* Consume Inventory Screen to remove consume inventory (and close out items no longer in use)
<hr>
<p>The key to dveloping any application is to develop a specification that outlines key use cases and functionality. It is vital to invlove stakeholders during all stages of the development lifecyle. Including the following:</p>

* Planning and Design
* Functional programming to create MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
* UI Development
* Testing, both for functionality and User Experience.
  - Testing edge cases to ensure application works under all circumstances
<hr>
<p>Overall, I felt this class was challenging and not for me. Mobile Application is not in my future. I had only limited success in developing the app. I was most successful with creating the planand specifications, and developing wireframes for the various screens. I was unsuccessful in ctually implementing the code to make a working example.</p>
